QUEUE data structure can be implemented using array or linked-list
QUEUE can be 3 types
1- single pointer 
this have pointer to the place of the last insearted one but how to delete the first one ?
always we delete the first element in the array or linked list after deleting shift so the next one will take 
the place to be deleted next time
ex:-
            4 17 8 9 13 (14) pointer point at 14 element but to delete we should delete the first element 4
            Then we shift the element one place to the left
            17 8 9 13 (14)

2- 2 pointers one for insearting and one for deleting
the list is empety wehn the two pointers pointing at the same location 



there is an important and efficient one called circular and that one i will implement here
